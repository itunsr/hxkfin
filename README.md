没错，那开口！那纹路！就是喇叭花的仿版。摘一朵喇叭花对着伙伴的耳畔大喊一声，吓得对方仓皇逃跑。早在留声机之前你们就流畅自如地使用着喇叭花的扩音效果。
　　他摇了摇头：“洋人才舍不得把她的嗓子变哑哩。他把阿恰付抢进教堂，把基督教教义编成傈僳调，叫阿妮她阿妈演唱，招引寨子里的人。阿恰付咬紧牙关，死活不肯唱，洋人就用手杖拼命地打她……”
　　感悟灵动至此，夜空中的风力正在加大，雨势也在跟着加强，很有一种夫唱妇随的意思。潜意识的比较中，我竟然无法长久地独立于阳台上形影相吊。我随即返回室内，一种长久不曾有过的忧伤感觉蓦地升上心头。无怪乎有那么多的文学作品里，都在有意或无意中就把风雨比作人生的坎坷与不幸。
"Let's see bleak, it is because someone keep in the dark let's see."
Our Chinese people never lack hero to cover up the dark, in this new coronary macro viruses by rampant in the festival, more let me see the "split" in self-denial in energy, grasp its truth.
Tender pink peach willow branches, buds, white pear.
And the song of the birds singing, this is the springtime.

I'm walking in the poem.
It was a group of good poetry, I get some touched by those lines.
For many years I have not touched so!
Had written some poems, young, eager to have a love of time, those lines make me become a melancholy, romantic woman.
I live for them, for them, and all his life.
For many years don't write poetry, only a story, a poetic no end of story.

Actually, huadu is no ending, no end is to be spent.
The poems and stories, like flowers, also in the chill of march to fall into the soil.
The fallen petal has a tragic beauty, in the wind swirl.
Swirl fall into the soil, covering soil, that is more tragic beauty.
Below three cherry tree on the grass, every march is rained in the night the wind into the soil.
I looked at the land of no on the window sill, inner for beautiful, as if the flowers are in martyrdom.
I don't know is for the season, or for love?
Or for life?
Or for anything else?
Only the flowers, only those cherry blossoms.
